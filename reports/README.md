# Report Framework
One of the main goals of DCSServerBot is gathering data of your DCS World servers 
and to display them in a useful format.<br/>
To achieve this, DCSServerBot already comes with some built-in reports. 
Many plugins display simple-to-complex data, which I thought might be of interest.
<p>
To allow you to change the look and feel of existing reports and to make it easier to build your own, I've developed 
a JSON-based reporting framework. Here you'll find the main features and elements of this framework.

## Using Reports in your Plugins
It is quite simple to generate a report in your plugins. You need to instantiate one of the available Report classes
with a json file which is stored in the ./reports subdirectory of your plugin.

```python
import discord

from core import command, Plugin, Report
from services.bot import DCSServerBot


class Test(Plugin):
   
   @command(description='Test')
   async def test(self, interaction: discord.Interaction):
      # we defer the interaction to avoid timeouts
      await interaction.response.defer()
      report = Report(self.bot, self.plugin_name, 'test.json')
      env = await report.render(params={"name": "Special K"})
      await interaction.followup.send(embed=env.embed)


async def setup(bot: DCSServerBot):
    await bot.add_cog(Test(bot))
```

## General Report Structure
Every report results in an Embed in Discord.<br/> 
An Embed has several attributes, and many of them can be set inside the report description:
```json
{
  "color": "blue",
  "mention": [
    112233445566,
    223344556677
  ],
  "title": "This is the title of the Embed.",
  "description": "This is a brief description.",
  "url": "https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot",
  "img": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot/master/images/play_256.png",
  "input": [],
  "pagination": {},
  "elements": [],
  "footer": "This is the footer (will be added to any other footers)"
}
```
Mentioning is done with role IDs. So you need to add the IDs of the roles to be mentioned in here.

### Input Section
Within the "input" section you can define variables that will be used inside the report or validate such, that came 
from your render(...) call.
```json
  "input":
  [
    {
      "name": "ruler_length",                          -- set a variable (here a reserved one, the length of the ruler)
      "value": 27                                      -- to a new value (default is 30)
    },
    {
      "name": "period",
      "range": ["", "day", "week", "month", "year"],   -- validate these passed parameters against a list of possible values
      "default": "day"                                 -- if no value for this variable is provided, set a default
    },
    {
      "sql": "SELECT ucid, name FROM players WHERE discord_id = %(discord_id)s"  -- read these parameters from the database
    },
    {
      "callback": "MissionFocusString"                 -- read a mission variable from DCS with this name
    }
  ],
```
### Pagination Section
Only needed for PaginationReports (see below).

### Elements Section
The "elements" section contains the real data that you want to present with your report.<br/>
You can either use pre-defined elements or write your own element by inheritance of one of the base classes provided by the framework.

### Variables
You usually work with variables that you pass to the corresponding render() call or that you define in the "input" section. These can be dictionaries like server- or player-data or just single values like server_name.
To use them in your reports, expect all strings to be f-string capable:
```json
{
  "title": "Report for Server {server_name}",
  "description": "Player {player[name]} is causing trouble."
}
```
Be aware that player\['name'\] is written as player\[name\] in the reports!

## Simple Report Elements for Embeds
The following elements can be used in your reports without any additional coding. Anybody familiar with Discord Embeds should be able to create a simple report with them.

### Ruler
A ruler, default size is 25 characters.
```json
"elements": [
  {
    "Ruler"
  }
]
```
Or if you want to change the size:
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Ruler",
      "params": {
        "ruler_length": 10
      }
    }
]
```
> [!NOTE]
> Discord allows a maximum size of 34 characters in an embed.

You can add a header, too:
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Ruler",
      "params": {
        "header": "Active Servers"
      }
    }
]
```

### Image
An image used as a thumbnail.
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Image",
      "params": {
        "url": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/a1/Flying_Hellfish_Logo.png"
      }
    }
]
```

### Field
A field with a single key/value pair. "default" is optional.
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Field",
      "params": {
        "name": "Name",
        "value": "Special K",
        "inline": false,
        "default": "n/a"
      }
    }
]
```

### Table
Multiple fields displayed as a table with a single header line and a maximum of 3 columns.
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Table",
      "params": {
        "values": [
          {
            "name": "Special K",
            "skill": "limited"
          },
          {
            "name": "Special A",
            "skill": "expert"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
]
```
A table can be built up from a passed object that needs to be a list of dict. The values section then contains
the key of the fields you want to use from these dictionaries and the name you want to display:
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "Table",
      "params": {
        "obj": "servers",
        "values": {
          "display_name": "Server Name",
          "status": "Status",
          "num_players": "Active Players"
        },
        "ansi_colors": false
      }
    }
]
```
If ansi_colors is set to true you can use color coding like `\u001b[0;31m` to color your values. 
Default is "false" and it is therefore optional. 
Works with SQLTables also (see the code of the `/infractions` command as an example).

### SQLField
If you want to display a single value from a database table, use the SQLField for it.
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "SQLField",
      "params": {
        "sql": "SELECT points AS \"Points\" FROM sb_points WHERE player_ucid = %(ucid)s",
        "inline": false,
        "no_data": { "Points": 0 },
        "on_error": { "Points": 0 }
      }
    }
]
```
If your query needs values, you can provide them as a dictionary to your report() call.

### SQLTable
Similar to the Table element but with values from an SQL query:
```json
"elements": [
    {
      "type": "SQLTable",
      "params": {
        "sql": "SELECT init_id as ucid, event, SUM(points) AS points FROM pu_events WHERE init_id = %(ucid)s GROUP BY 1,2",
        "no_data": "You have no points yet!",
        "on_error": "An error occured: {ex}"
      }
    }
]
```
> [!NOTE]
> "no_data" can be either a string or a dictionary.<br>
> In case of a string, the "name" value will be empty.

## Graph Elements
To display nice graphics like bar-charts or pie-charts, you need to wrap them in a Graph element:
```json
"elements": [
  {
    "type": "Graph",
    "params": {
      "width": 10,            -- width of the resulting image in inch
      "height": 10,           -- height of the resulting image in inch
      "cols": 2,              -- number of columns in the grid
      "rows": 1,              -- number of rows in the grid
      "wspace": 0.5,          -- horizontal spacing between subplots
      "hspace": 0.5,          -- vertical spacing between subplots
      "dpi": 100,             -- DPI of the image
      "facecolor": "#2C2F33", -- the background color of the image
      "elements": [
        ... describe your GraphElements in here ...
      ]
    }
  }      
]
```
> [!NOTE]
> Only one Graph element is allowed per report.

You can configure sub-elements like so:
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "xxx",    -- the type of the element (BarChart, PieChart, etc.)
        "params": {
        "col": 0,         -- the x position of the chart in the grid
        "row": 0,         -- the y position of the chart in the grid
        "colspan": 1,     -- optional: the number of columns that this chart uses
        "rowspan": 1      -- optional: the number of rows that this chart uses
      }
    ]
```

### BarChart
Simple bar chart that will display all elements of a given dictionary.
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "BarChart",
        "params": {
          "col": 0,
          "row": 0,
          "title": "Test BarChart",
          "color": "blue",
          "rotate_labels": 30,         -- rotate the labels by 30Â°        
          "bar_labels": true,          -- put the value of each bar at the top
          "is_time": true,             -- select the time formatter
          "orientation": "horizontal", -- set the orientation (vertical is default)
          "show_no_data": false,       -- if no data is available, don't display "No data available." but nothing
          "values": { "Takeoffs": 2, "Landings": 1, "Crashes": 1 }
        }
      }
    ]
```

### SQLBarChart
Same as bar chart, but with an SQL to grab the data from the database.
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "SQLBarChart",
        "params": {
          "col": 0,
          "row": 0,
          "title": "Kills & Deaths",
          "sql": "SELECT SUM(kills) AS Kills, SUM(deaths) AS Deaths FROM statistics WHERE player_ucid = %(ucid)s"
        }
      }
    ]
```

### PieChart
Simple pie chart that will display all elements of a given dictionary.
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "PieChart",
        "params": {
          "col": 0,
          "row": 0,
          "title": "Test PieChart",
          "is_time": true,             -- select the time formatter
          "show_no_data": false,       -- if no data is available, don't display "No data available." but nothing
          "values": { "Takeoffs": 2, "Landings": 1, "Crashes": 1 }
        }
      }
    ]
```

### SQLPieChart
Same as pie chart, but with an SQL to grab the data from the database.
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "SQLPieChart",
        "params": {
          "col": 0,
          "row": 0,
          "title": "Test PieChart",
          "sql": "SELECT SUM(kills) AS Kills, SUM(deaths) AS Deaths FROM statistics WHERE player_ucid = %(ucid)s"
        }
      }
    ]
```

## Report Types

There are three report types that you can use:

1. **Report**  
   Standard implementation. Will output a single report as an embed.

2. **PaginationReport**  
   Will enable pagination based on a provided parameter list.

3. **PersistentReport**  
   For auto-updates. Every time a persistent report is generated, it will update the former embed.

Let's look at the more complex ones.

### PaginationReport
To use a PaginationReport, your code could look like the following:

```python
import discord

from discord import app_commands
from typing import Optional

from core import command, utils, Plugin, Server, PaginationReport
from plugins.userstats.filter import (StatisticsFilter, PeriodFilter, CampaignFilter, MissionFilter, PeriodTransformer, 
                                      TheatreFilter)
from services.bot import DCSServerBot


class Test(Plugin):

   @command(description='Pagination Test')
   async def test(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, 
                  period: Optional[app_commands.Transform[
                                StatisticsFilter, PeriodTransformer(
                                    flt=[PeriodFilter, CampaignFilter, MissionFilter, TheatreFilter]
                                )]] = PeriodFilter(),
                  server: Optional[app_commands.Transform[Server, utils.ServerTransformer]] = None):
      # we defer the interaction to avoid timeouts
      await interaction.response.defer()
      report = PaginationReport(interaction, plugin=self.plugin_name, filename='mytest.json')
      await report.render(period=period, server_name=server.name if server else None)


async def setup(bot: DCSServerBot):
    await bot.add_cog(Test(bot))
```
> [!NOTE]
> Providing None to the pagination value (here server_name) will result in None being the first element to allow 
> aggregated displays. If you provide a strict value, this will be the first to be displayed out of the pagination list.


In your report, you have to specify a pagination section:
```json
{
  "color": "blue",
  "title": "My Pagination Test",
  "input": [
    {
      "name": "period",
      "range": ["", "day", "week", "month", "year"],
      "default": "day"
    }
  ],
  "pagination":
  {
    "param":
    {
      "name": "server_name",
      "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT server_name FROM missions"
    }
  },
  "elements": []
}
```
Now you can use {server_name} in your report elements:
```json
    "elements": [
      {
        "type": "SQLPieChart",
        "params": {
          "col": 0,
          "row": 0,
          "title": "Server Time",
          "sql": "select mission_name, ROUND(SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (mission_end - mission_start))) / 3600) FROM missions GROUP BY 1 WHERE server_name LIKE '{server_name}'"
        }
      }
    ]
```

### Persistent Report
To use a PersistentReport, in general you produce a normal report but provide a unique key with it, that will be used to access and update it later on.

```python
import discord

from discord import app_commands
from typing import Optional

from core import command, utils, Plugin, Server, PersistentReport
from plugins.userstats.filter import (StatisticsFilter, PeriodFilter, CampaignFilter, MissionFilter, PeriodTransformer, 
                                      TheatreFilter)
from services.bot import DCSServerBot


class Test(Plugin):

   @command(description='Pagination Test')
   async def test(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, 
                  period: Optional[app_commands.Transform[
                                StatisticsFilter, PeriodTransformer(
                                    flt=[PeriodFilter, CampaignFilter, MissionFilter, TheatreFilter]
                                )]] = PeriodFilter(),
                  server: Optional[app_commands.Transform[Server, utils.ServerTransformer]] = None):
       report = PersistentReport(self.bot, plugin=self.plugin_name, filename='mytest.json', embed_name="myfancyreport")
       await report.render(period=period, server_name=server.name if server else None)


async def setup(bot: DCSServerBot):
    await bot.add_cog(Test(bot))
```

Whenever you call `/test`, you will not generate a new report but update the existing one.<br/>
> [!WARNING]
> The key is unique in that server. 
> You must not use the same key for two different reports, they will overwrite each other.
