# Plugin "MissionStats"
When enabled, this plugin will generate a persistent mission statistics embed to be displayed in the status channels and 
detailed statistics from the in-game event system. The global DCSServerBot.lua and a plugin specific mission.lua will 
automatically be loaded into any mission running on that specific server.

## Configuration
Missionstats needs the Userstats plugin to be loaded first (default).

The configuration is held in config/plugins/missionstats.yaml:
```yaml
DCS.release_server:
  enabled: true                   # false: disable mission statistics gathering (default: true)
  display: true                   # false: don't show mission statistics in your status channel (default: true)
  persistence: true               # false: don't persist the mission statistics to database (default: true)
  persist_ai_statistics: false    # true: persist AI statistics to the database (default: false)
  event_filter:                   # Optional: do not receive these events (the events listed is the default list and will always be ignored unless defined differently!)
    - S_EVENT_MARK_ADDED
    - S_EVENT_MARK_REMOVED
    - S_EVENT_TOOK_CONTROL
    - S_EVENT_DISCARD_CHAIR_AFTER_EJECTION
    - S_EVENT_AI_ABORT_MISSION
    - S_EVENT_SHOOTING_START
    - S_EVENT_SHOOTING_END
  mission_end:                    # optional: display a final mission statistics embed at mission end
    persistent: true              # send a persistent mission end embed (default: non persistent) 
    channel: 1122334455667788     # channel to display the embed in
    title: Mission accomplished!  # alternative title (default: Mission Result)
```

> [!NOTE]
> When creating a custom event_filter, list all events that you want to EXCLUDE from being sent to the bot. Note that
> creating a new filter starts fresh - it won't automatically include the default excluded events. If you want to keep
> those default exclusions, you'll need to add them explicitly to your custom filter.


## How to disable Missionstats inside of missions
To disable mission statistics for a specific mission, you can use the following piece of code somewhere in your mission 
(not in an on-startup trigger, but shortly after).
```lua
  dcsbot.disableMissionStats()
```
