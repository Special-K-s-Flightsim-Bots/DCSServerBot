# Plugin "Battlegound"
The Battleground plugin adds commands for the [DCSBattleground](https://github.com/Frigondin/DCSBattleground/) tool.</br> 
The plugin use the [Coalition](../../COALITIONS.md) feature for communication with the database, so you need to set 
the "blue" and "red" channel in your servers.yaml.

## DCSBattlegound's configuration
As Battleground is an optional plugin, you need to activate it in main.yaml first like so:
```yaml
opt_plugins:
  - battleground
```

DCSBattleground is a sneaker's fork created by Frigondin, you can find all information about it [here](https://github.com/Frigondin/DCSBattleground/).</br>
You can find a wiki with some examples and an introduction to the tool [here](https://github.com/Frigondin/DCSBattleground/wiki).</br>

An extension for DCSBattleground will be created at a later stage, so it can't be auto-started by DCSServerBot for now.
