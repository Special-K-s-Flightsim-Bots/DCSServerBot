# Extension "LotAtc"
Another famous extension for DCS is [LotAtc](https://www.lotatc.com/) by D'Art. If you think about any kind of proper
GCI or ATC work, there is no way around it. It perfectly integrates with DCS and DCS-SRS.<br/>
You'll get a notification in your servers status embed about ports and - if you like - passwords and the version of 
LotAtc printed in the footer. If a GCI gets active on your server, players of the respective coalition will be informed
via the in-game chat and a popup. Same if the GCI leaves their slot again.

## Configuration
