# Bot Service
This is the Discord bot implementation, the one that's providing all the commands and embeds that are displayed in your
Discord server.

## Configuration
The configuration is quite basic, please check out the installation guide in the main [README](../../README.md).
After you have installed DCSServerBot, a file named config/services/bot.yaml will be there for you to amend to your
requirements:

```yaml
token: SECRET DISCORD TOKEN COMES HERE          # Your TOKEN, do not change this
owner: 1122334455667788                         # The ID of your bot user. Right click, select "Copy User ID".
automatch: true                                 # Use the bots auto-matching functionality (see README), default is true.
autoban: false                                  # Use the bots auto-ban functionality (see README), default is false.
message_ban: User has been banned on Discord.   # Default reason to show people that try to join your DCS servers when they are banned on Discord.
message_autodelete: 300                         # Most of the Discord messages are private messages. If not, this is the timeout after that they vanish. Default is 300 (5 mins).
admin_channel: 1122334455667788                 # Optional: Central admin channel (see README).
greeting_dm: 'Welcome at {guild}, {name}. Please use /linkme in our Discord to link your DCS account.'
reports:
  num_workers: 4                                # Number of worker threads to be used for any reports generated by the bot. Default is 4.
  cjk_font: KR                                  # Optional: You can specify a CJK font to be used in your reports.

audit_channel: 88776655443322                   # Central audit channel to send audit events to (default: none)
roles:                                          # Roles mapping. The bot uses internal roles to decouple from Discord own role system.
  Admin:                                        # Map your Discord role "Admin" to the bots role "Admin" (default: Admin)
  - Admin
  DCS Admin:                                    # Map your Discord role "Moderator" and "Staff" to the bots "DCS Admin" role (default: DCS Admin)
  - Moderator
  - Staff
  GameMaster:                                   # Give the GameMaster role to anybody with the Staff role in your Discord.
  - Staff
  DCS:                                          # Give the bots DCS role to everyone in your discord. Only everyone needs the leading @!
  - @everyone
```
